The B library is a collection of data structures, algorithms, and utility
classes and functions.

Why write another library of generic types when there is the C++ Standard
Library?  The main reason is to have a full control over the implementation.
The problem is, the Standard Library is not really a library. Rather, it is a
Library Standard. It defines the API that the standard library of every C++
compiler must conform to. However, there is no reference or universal
implementation of the library.  The multiplatform nature of C++ is one of the
apparent explanations for that.  I for one need to know what goes into my
application.  I need to know implementation details.  And I'm willing to
sacrifice compatibility with non-POSIX systems to achieve that goal.

There is also another prominent motive.  Over the years, I grew disenchanted
with C++, especially when new, conceptually sound compiled languages started
to emerge. Who knows how many of those languages were developed out of
frustration with C++? D is a clear example of that. If there really is a
smaller and cleaner language within C++ struggling to get out, well, that
struggle is real. The way I see it, you cannot make the language lean and at
the same time keep compatibility with all the accumulated cruft that's rooted
in C.

That being said, C++ is the only compiled language that is available on all
platforms, so I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. The B library is
the tool that makes programming in C++ a more enjoyable experience for me.

The library provides the following functionality:

#include <b/arg_list.h>                 b::arg_list

    Implementation of an obscure technique for passing a variable-length
    list of named parameters to a function or a method.


#include <b/array.h>                    b::array<T>

    Array template type. Uses the copy-on-write technique for memory
    management.


#include <b/binary_tree.h>              b::binary_search_tree<Key_op>

    Low-level structure that implements a non-balancing binary search tree.


#include <b/cli.h>                      b::cli

    POSIX-compatible command line parser and help screen generator.


#include <b/heap.h>                     b::heap<T>

    Priority heap implementation.


#include <b/levenshtein_distance.h>     b::levenshtein_distance

    Edit distance calculation.


#include <b/map.h>                      b::map<Key, T>

    Template implementation of an associative array container type.


#include <b/object.h>                   b::object

    Base class with reference count support.


#include <b/pathname.h>                 b::pathname

    Pathname parsing and normalization with additional modification
    operations.


#include <b/random.h>                   b::random

    A linear congruential generator.


#include <b/ref_count.h>                b::ref_count

    Portable thread-safe reference counter.


#include <b/ref.h>                      b::ref

    Smart pointer to instances of all classes derived from 'b::object'.


#include <b/set.h>                      b::set<T>

    A set of unique objects of type T.


#include <b/string.h>                   b::string
                                        b::wstring

    Generic string type, both byte character and wide character
    versions.  Uses the copy-on-write technique.


#include <b/string_view.h>              b::string_view
                                        b::wstring_view

    A pointer to a string segment. Useful in parameters and for
    temporary strings.


#include <b/io_streams.h>               b::input_stream
                                        b::output_stream
                                        b::seekable
                                        b::seekable_input_stream
                                        b::seekable_output_stream
                                        b::input_output_stream

    Various input/output interfaces.


#include <b/doubly_linked_list.h>       b::doubly_linked_list<Node_access>
#include <b/doubly_linked_list_container.h>
                                        b::doubly_linked_list_container<T>
#include <b/linked_list.h>              b::linked_list<Node_access>
#include <b/linked_list_container.h>    b::linked_list_container<T>

    Various linked list classes.


#include <b/exception.h>                b::exception
#include <b/runtime_exception.h>        b::runtime_exception
#include <b/custom_exception.h>         b::custom_exception
#include <b/system_exception.h>         b::system_exception

    Various exception classes.
