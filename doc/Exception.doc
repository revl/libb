/**
@class b::Exception

The base class for all exception classes. This class contains neither data nor
methods. However, the size of objects of this class is equal to the size of
pointer since this class defines its virtual destructor, which is required for
correct destruction of objects of the derived classes. The destructor contains
no exceptions in its exception specification list so that the derived classes
may not through exceptions.
